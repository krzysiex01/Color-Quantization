# Color-Quantization

Simple UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application implementing popular color quantization algorithms.
Provided UI allows users to easily add new images (Drag&Drop), set number of colors after reduction and compare the results.

Implemented algorithms:
* Error Diffusion Dithering
* Popularity Algorithm
* K-Means Algorithm
